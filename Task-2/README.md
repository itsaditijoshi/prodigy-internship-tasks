# Task 2 – Image Classification using CNN and Machine Learning

## ✨ Objective
To classify images using two different approaches:
- A **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**
- A **Machine Learning model**

## 🗂️ Dataset
We used the [Dogs vs Cats dataset by Microsoft](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dogs-vs-cats/data) available on Kaggle.

## 🔍 Approach

### 1. CNN Model
- Framework: TensorFlow / Keras
- Steps:
  - Data augmentation
  - Image resizing
  - Model building with Conv2D, MaxPooling, Dense layers
  - Compiling & training the model
  - Evaluation on test set

### 2. Machine Learning Model
- Steps:
  - Feature extraction from images (e.g., using HOG or flattening)
  - Preprocessing (normalization)
  - Model selection (Random Forest / SVM / Logistic Regression)
  - Training and testing

## 📊 Results
Both approaches were compared in terms of accuracy and performance.  
CNN outperformed traditional ML models in image classification.

## 💻 Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib, numpy, pandas
